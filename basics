# Basics

```python
> print(”hello world. \n This is Sai”)

# \n breaks the line to 2.

Output:
hello world
This is Sai
```

type(”X“) → Anything in the place of X will be string. ‘type’ function will help users to understand the datatype of the given in ().

```python
Example
> type(1+2j)

Output: Complex
```

```python
#Variables are case sensistive
> name = 'Sai'
> Name = 'Nukala'
```

```python
>[1]: 1+3
Output:[1]: 4
#Here the output is just a calculation.

>[1]: print(1+3)
Output: 4
#Here the output is calculated and OUTPUT is projected
```

```python
#Concatenation
> "1" + "1"
Output: '11'

> int("1") + int("1") #Converting the variable to Integer.
Output: 2

```

```python
#Print

#V1
>print("Hello world")
Hello World

#V2
>age=32
>print("My age is:",age)
My age is: 32

#V3 Important
>print("My age is: {age}")
My age is: {age}

>print(f"My age is: {age}")
#f is foratting.
My age is: 32

```

```python
#Format()

name="Sai"
age=31

print("My name is {} and age is {}".format(name,age))
Output: My name is Sai and age is 31
#The format function feature is limited here. If the values 'name','age' changes the output reflects the same values accordingly.
print("My name is {} and age is {}".format(age,name))
Output: My name is 31 and age is Sai.

#Format #Placeholder
print("My name is {FirstName} & age is {NoOfYrs}".format(FirstName=name,NoOfYrs=age))
Output: My name is Sai & age is 31
#Placeholder is the holder of variables at fixed location.
print("My name is {FirstName} & age is {NoOfYrs}".format(NoOfYrs=age,FirstName=name))
Output: My name is Sai & age is 31

#Example for Format()
name="Sai Nukala"
age=31
degree="B.Tech"

print(f"My name is {name}, age is {age} & I've pursuied my {degree}")

print("My name is {}, age is {} & I've pursuied my {}".format(name,age,degree))

print("My name is {MyName}, age is {MyAge} & I've pursuied my {MyDegree}".format(MyName=name,MyAge=age,MyDegree=degree))
